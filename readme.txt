MoM IME v0.9.9.7 quick instructions
-----------------------------------

Here's some quick notes on how to get a game up and running in case some parts aren't obvious:

 1) Unzip momime0.9.9.7.zip somewhere.  I recommend you don't put this under
    C:\Program Files, or anywhere else Windows doesn't like files being modified.
    Straight under C:\, in your user home folder, or on another drive letter are fine.

 2) You must have a Java 11 or higher.  There are now 2 builds of MoM IME, one which has
    a 64 bit Windows Java runtime environment already included and can just be unzipped and ran,
	so use this if you do not want to do your own configuration.  The smaller download does not
	include a jre so can be used if you already have Java installed and configured, or are trying to
	run it on some platform other than 64 bit WIndows.

 3) Run the server.  After a few seconds it'll say
    "Listening for client connection requests on port 18250".
    Nothing else to do here, just leave the window open.

 4) Run the client.  This takes significantly longer to start up (1 minute+) as it
    reads in a lot of the graphics files and performs a lot of consistency checks
    on them before starting up.

 5) Click connect to server.  Click localhost (for the server running on your own PC).
    Enter a player name and password.  Since this is the first time you're connecting to
    your server, tick "This is a new account".  In the future, leave this box unticked and
    make sure you use the same name and password.

 6) Click "New Game".  Note the "OK" button is disabled.  To get it enabled you have to add
    at least one opponent (Human and/or AI) and enter a game name at the bottom.
    Feel free to change any of the other options, and you can tick "customize" to manually
    specify any of the game values.

 7) Pick a predefined wizard or "Custom".  For custom wizards, you then choose a portrait, and
    picking choose "Custom" again will let you pick any GIF/PNG/JPG file for your wizard
    portrait, up to a max size of 218x250.
 
 8) Pick starting spells and a race.  If you chose no Human opponents, the game will now start
    up automatically; if you chose human opponents, you have to wait for them to join and
    go through their wizard and race choices before the game will start.

 9) After the game starts up I hope it should be self explanatory to anyone used to the original MoM.
    A lot of features aren't implemented yet, e.g. on the "Info" menu the
    only Advisors that work so far are the Apprentice, Surveyor and Tax Collector.

10) Saving and loading games has now been added but note this doesn't work quite like the original MoM.
    Games are autosaved every turn, so there is no explicit save button.  Games may be reloaded only
    by the same player who created the game in the first place.  If a saved multiplayer game, the additonal
	players must then join the loaded game just like when creating a new game, before it will start back up.

11) While there are language files for a couple of languages besides English, these are now extremely
    out of date and haven't been updated for many versions, so the game won't work very well if you
    try to pick one of these.  If any native language speakers wish to volunteer to try to complete
    any of these partial translations or add new ones, it would be much appreciated.

NB. All the windows in the client can be moved around by dragging an empty piece of the window
    away from any buttons or other controls.  Only the overland map window can be resized.

I'd like to put out a thank you to the folks at the MoM wiki - http://masterofmagic.wikia.com
The amount and level of detail of information they've collected there about the rules and all
other aspects of the original MoM has been invaluable and saved me a lot of time and guesswork
trying to figure out how the original MoM worked for myself.
